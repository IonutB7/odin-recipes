    <img src="https://www.licious.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Chicken-Strips.jpg" alt="Crispy Strips" >
    <p>Crispy strips are a popular and versatile food that can be enjoyed as a snack, a side dish, or even a main course. They are usually made from chicken, beef, or tofu that has been marinated, breaded, and then fried to golden perfection. The crispy exterior provides a satisfying crunch, while the tender and juicy interior packs a flavorful punch</p>
    <p>There are many variations of crispy strips, each with its own unique taste and texture. Some popular versions include classic southern-style buttermilk chicken strips, spicy Cajun-style strips, and crispy panko-breaded tofu strips for a vegetarian option. They can be served on their own with a dipping sauce, added to salads, sandwiches, or wraps, or paired with classic sides like french fries, coleslaw, or baked beans. No matter how you choose to enjoy them, crispy strips are a tasty and convenient option for any meal or snack.</p>
